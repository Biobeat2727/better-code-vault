## ðŸ§± Common Folder Layouts

### Frontend (React/Next.js)

```
/src
  /components
  /hooks
  /pages
  /styles
  /utils
/tests
/public
.env
README.md
```

---

## ðŸ§  Notes

- Use modular design: each feature/component has its own folder
- Separate logic (hooks/utils) from UI (components)
- Keep config and setup files at the root
