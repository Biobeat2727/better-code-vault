**Category**: Creational Â 

**Purpose**: Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.

## ðŸ§  Concept

A singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object and ensures controlled access to that instance.

Â  constructor() {

Â  Â  if (AppSettings.instance) return AppSettings.instance;

Â  Â  this.darkMode = false;

Â  Â  AppSettings.instance = this;

Â  }

}

const settings1 = new AppSettings();

const settings2 = new AppSettings();

console.log(settings1 === settings2); // true

```
