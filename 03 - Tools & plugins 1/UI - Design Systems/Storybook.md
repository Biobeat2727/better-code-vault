Stories

A story captures the rendered state of a UI component. Each component can have multiple stories, where each story describes a different component state.

Docs

Storybook can analyze your components to automatically create documentation alongside your stories. This automatic documentation makes it easier for you to create UI library usage guidelines, design system sites, and more.

Testing

Stories are a pragmatic starting point for your UI testing strategy. You already write stories as a natural part of UI development, so testing those stories is a low-effort way to prevent UI bugs over time.

Sharing

Publishing your Storybook allows you to share your work with others. You can also embed your stories in places like Notion or Figma.
