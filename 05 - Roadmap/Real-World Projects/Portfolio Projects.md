## üéØ Portfolio Strategy Framework

### Portfolio Objectives

```js
const portfolioGoals = {
  // Primary purposes
  primaryGoals: [
    "Demonstrate technical skills relevant to target roles",
    "Show progression and growth over time", 
    "Highlight problem-solving and creativity",
    "Prove ability to build complete, functional applications",
    "Establish personal brand and professional identity"
  ],

  // Target audiences
  audiences: {
    recruiters: {
      attention: "30 seconds",
      focus: ["Clean design", "Clear descriptions", "Impressive results"],
      needs: ["Quick skill assessment", "Easy navigation", "Contact information"]
    },
    
    techLeads: {
      attention: "3-5 minutes",
      focus: ["Code quality", "Architecture decisions", "Technical depth"],
      needs: ["GitHub links", "Technical documentation", "Problem-solving approach"]
    },
    
    developers: {
      attention: "10-15 minutes",
      focus: ["Implementation details", "Code patterns", "Innovation"],
      needs: ["Source code access", "Technical blog posts", "Community contributions"]
    }
  }
};
```

### Quality Over Quantity Rule

```markdown
# Portfolio Project Requirements

## Better to have:
- 3-5 exceptional projects with detailed explanations
- Clear progression from simple to complex
- Diverse skill demonstration
- Professional presentation and documentation

## Rather than:
- 10+ basic tutorial projects
- Similar projects with minor variations  
- Incomplete or poorly documented work
- Projects without clear learning objectives
```
