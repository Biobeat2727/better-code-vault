Effective time management for developers requires balancing deep work, learning, collaboration, and administrative tasks. Master these techniques to maximize productivity and maintain work-life balance.

## 🎯 Core Principles

**Deep Work First**: Protect high-energy time for complex problem-solving  
**Batch Similar Tasks**: Group similar activities to minimize context switching  
**Time-box Everything**: Set limits to prevent tasks from expanding indefinitely  
**Plan Tomorrow Today**: End each day by planning the next  
**Energy Management**: Match task difficulty to your energy levels

## 🕐 Time Blocking & Scheduling

### Daily Time Block Template

```
08:00-09:00  🌅 Morning Routine & Planning
09:00-11:30  💻 Deep Work Block 1 (Complex Features)
11:30-11:45  ☕ Break
11:45-12:30  📧 Email & Communication
12:30-13:30  🍽️ Lunch Break
13:30-15:00  💻 Deep Work Block 2 (Coding/Problem Solving)
15:00-15:15  ☕ Break
15:15-16:00  🔍 Code Reviews & Testing
16:00-16:30  📋 Admin Tasks & Planning
16:30-17:00  📚 Learning & Research
17:00-17:15  📝 Daily Wrap-up & Tomorrow's Plan
```

### Weekly Time Allocation

```js
const weeklyTimeAllocation = {
  development: "60%",     // 24 hours - Core coding work
  meetings: "15%",        // 6 hours - Standups, planning, reviews
  learning: "10%",        // 4 hours - New technologies, courses
  administration: "10%",  // 4 hours - Email, docs, reporting
  buffer: "5%"           // 2 hours - Unexpected issues
};
```

### Context Switching Minimization

```js
// ❌ Bad: Constant context switching
function chaoticDay() {
  // 9:00 - Start feature A
  // 9:30 - Check email
  // 9:45 - Fix bug in feature B
  // 10:15 - Attend unexpected meeting
  // 10:45 - Back to feature A (lost context)
  // 11:00 - Slack notification, help teammate
  // 11:30 - Where was I with feature A?
}

// ✅ Good: Batched activities
function focusedDay() {
  // 9:00-11:30 - Deep work on feature A (no interruptions)
  // 11:30-12:00 - Email and communication batch
  // 12:00-13:00 - Lunch
  // 13:00-15:00 - Feature A continued or feature B
  // 15:00-15:30 - Code reviews and helping teammates
}
```

## ⚡ Productivity Techniques

### Pomodoro Technique for Developers

```js
const pomodoroForDevelopers = {
  // Standard 25-minute focus sessions
  shortPomodoro: {
    work: "25 minutes",
    break: "5 minutes",
    useFor: ["Bug fixes", "Writing tests", "Documentation", "Email"]
  },
  
  // Extended 50-minute sessions for complex work
  longPomodoro: {
    work: "50 minutes", 
    break: "10 minutes",
    useFor: ["Complex features", "Architecture design", "Learning new tech"]
  },
  
  // Ultra-focus 90-minute blocks
  deepWork: {
    work: "90 minutes",
    break: "20 minutes", 
    useFor: ["Major features", "System design", "Performance optimization"]
  }
};

// Pomodoro tracking
function startPomodoro(type = 'short') {
  const durations = {
    short: 25 * 60 * 1000,
    long: 50 * 60 * 1000,
    deep: 90 * 60 * 1000
  };
  
  console.log(`🍅 Starting ${type} pomodoro session`);
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('⏰ Pomodoro complete! Time for a break.');
    // Play notification sound
    // Track completed session
  }, durations[type]);
}
```

### Getting Things Done (GTD) for Developers

```js
const gtdSystem = {
  // Capture everything in one place
  inbox: [
    "Fix login bug reported by user",
    "Learn React 18 concurrent features", 
    "Review Sarah's pull request",
    "Update deployment documentation"
  ],
  
  // Categorize and organize
  organize: {
    nextActions: [
      "Reproduce login bug in dev environment",
      "Read React 18 docs for 30 minutes"
    ],
    waiting: [
      "Waiting for design mockups from UI team",
      "Waiting for API key from third-party service"
    ],
    someday: [
      "Learn Rust programming language",
      "Build personal portfolio redesign"
    ],
    projects: [
      {
        name: "User Authentication Refactor",
        nextAction: "Create technical specification document",
        deadline: "2025-08-15"
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

### Eisenhower Matrix for Tech Tasks

```js
const taskPrioritization = {
  // Quadrant 1: Urgent + Important (Do First)
  doFirst: [
    "Production bug affecting all users",
    "Security vulnerability needs immediate patch",
    "Critical feature demo tomorrow"
  ],
  
  // Quadrant 2: Important + Not Urgent (Schedule)
  schedule: [
    "Refactor legacy codebase",
    "Learn new framework for upcoming project",
    "Write comprehensive tests for core features"
  ],
  
  // Quadrant 3: Urgent + Not Important (Delegate)
  delegate: [
    "Update project documentation",
    "Respond to non-critical support tickets",
    "Attend optional team meeting"
  ],
  
  // Quadrant 4: Not Urgent + Not Important (Eliminate)
  eliminate: [
    "Endless Slack conversations",
    "Reading tech news during work hours",
    "Optimizing code that's already fast enough"
  ]
};
```
