A consistent daily routine builds coding skills, maintains momentum, and creates sustainable progress. Structure your day for maximum productivity and learning.

---

## 🌅 Morning Routine (30-45 minutes)

### Code Review & Planning (10 minutes)

- Review yesterday's commits and pull requests
- Check any code review feedback received
- Scan team Slack/Discord for important updates
- Review today's tasks and priorities

### Problem Solving Warm-up (15-20 minutes)

```js
// Daily coding challenge routine
// 1. Pick a platform: LeetCode, Codewars, HackerRank
// 2. Choose difficulty based on time available:
//    - 5 min: Easy problem
//    - 15 min: Medium problem  
//    - 30 min: Hard problem
// 3. Focus on different topics each day:
//    - Monday: Arrays & Strings
//    - Tuesday: Trees & Graphs
//    - Wednesday: Dynamic Programming
//    - Thursday: System Design
//    - Friday: Review & Favorites
```

### Learning Block (10-15 minutes)

- Read one article from your learning queue
- Watch a short tutorial video
- Review documentation for tools you're using
- Practice typing speed (aim for 70+ WPM)

## 🎯 Work Session Structure

### Pomodoro Technique (25 min work + 5 min break)

```
Session 1: High-focus work (debugging, complex features)
Session 2: Medium-focus work (writing tests, refactoring)
Session 3: Low-focus work (documentation, code reviews)
Session 4: Planning & cleanup
```

### Deep Work Blocks (2-4 hours)

- Turn off notifications
- Close email and Slack
- Work on one major feature or problem
- Use "Do Not Disturb" status
- Keep water and snacks nearby

### Context Switching Minimization

```
❌ Bad: Jump between 5 different projects
✅ Good: Batch similar tasks together

Examples:
- All code reviews at once
- All testing in one session  
- All documentation together
- All bug fixes in sequence
```

## 📝 Daily Coding Practices

### Code Quality Habits

```js
// Before writing any code, ask:
const qualityChecklist = {
  // 1. Do I understand the requirements?
  requirements: "What exactly needs to be built?",
  
  // 2. What's the simplest solution?
  simplicity: "Can this be done with less code?",
  
  // 3. How will I test this?
  testing: "What are the edge cases?",
  
  // 4. Is this readable?
  readability: "Will my teammate understand this in 6 months?",
  
  // 5. Is this performant enough?
  performance: "Are there any obvious bottlenecks?"
};
```

### Documentation as You Go

```js
// ✅ Good: Document while coding
function calculateShipping(weight, distance, priority) {
  // Business rule: Priority shipping costs 2x normal rate
  // Weight over 50lbs gets 20% surcharge
  // Distance over 1000mi gets $10 flat fee
  
  let baseCost = weight * 0.5 + distance * 0.01;
  
  if (weight > 50) {
    baseCost *= 1.2; // 20% surcharge
  }
  
  if (distance > 1000) {
    baseCost += 10; // Flat fee
  }
  
  return priority ? baseCost * 2 : baseCost;
}
```

### Git Workflow Discipline

```bash
# Daily git habits
git status          # Always check status first
git diff            # Review changes before committing
git add -p          # Add changes in chunks
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication"  # Clear commit messages
git push origin feature-branch  # Push regularly
```

## 🔍 Learning Integration

### Active Learning During Work

- When you copy code from Stack Overflow, understand it first
- Try to explain complex code to a rubber duck
- Write mini-experiments to test your understanding
- Document patterns you discover

### Knowledge Capture System

```markdown
# Daily Learning Log Template

## Date: 2025-07-19

### What I Learned Today
- [ ] New concept/pattern discovered
- [ ] Problem solved and how
- [ ] Tool/library explored
- [ ] Best practice identified

### What I Struggled With
- [ ] Issue encountered
- [ ] Time spent debugging
- [ ] Solution found or still investigating

### Tomorrow's Focus
- [ ] Top priority task
- [ ] Learning goal
- [ ] Problem to solve
```

---

## 🐛 Debug & Problem Solving Flow

### Systematic Debugging (15-20 minutes max per session)

```js
const debuggingProcess = {
  step1: "Reproduce the bug consistently",
  step2: "Read error messages carefully", 
  step3: "Add console.logs to trace execution",
  step4: "Use debugger/breakpoints",
  step5: "Check recent changes in git",
  step6: "Search for similar issues online",
  step7: "Ask for help if stuck > 30 minutes"
};

// Time-boxing prevents rabbit holes
function debugWithTimeLimit(problem, maxMinutes = 30) {
  const startTime = Date.now();
  
  // Try systematic approach
  while (Date.now() - startTime < maxMinutes * 60000) {
    // Debug systematically
  }
  
  // If not solved, get help or take a break
  askForHelp(problem);
}
```

## 🕐 Energy Management

### Peak Performance Hours

```
High Energy (Complex work):

- Architecture design  
- Learning new concepts
- Debugging hard problems

Medium Energy (Routine work):
- Writing tests
- Code reviews
- Documentation
- Refactoring

Low Energy (Administrative):
- Updating tickets
- Responding to emails
